			<h1>Origins of Signatures for Soldiers</h1>
			<p>Signatures For Soldiers is my personal effort to raise money for Military Missions In Action, a registered 501(c)3 that supports disabled military veterans and disabled children of activity duty military personnel by completely home repairs, remodels, and renovations at no cost to the recipients or their families.  Military Missions In Action also supports homeless veterans by providing hygiene items, clothing, and furniture for newly housed homeless veterans.  Military Missions In Action also supports deployed active duty military personnel by sending care packages to them during their deployments.  Since being founded in January 2008, Military Missions In Action has provided over $3.5 million worth of services while keeping their annual administrative costs under 10%.</p>

			<p>I've been involved with Military Missions In Action as a volunteer, fundraiser, member of their Board of Directors, and now as a member of their Advisory Board.  I've collected autographs as a hobby since the age of 14 and wanted to combine my passion for helping veterans in need and my hobby.  As a result, I have been reaching out to various athletes and celebrities asking for them to sign autographs knowing that I would be selling the autographs and 100% of the money would go directly to Military Missions In Action to support their mission to help disabled veterans.</p>

			<p>Since I've started this effort in November 2014, I've been able to raise almost $10,000 and have the support of more than 300 players.  And those numbers continue to grow thanks to the generosity of so many people.</p>
