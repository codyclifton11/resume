          <li>Jake Arrieta is one of the better pitchers on this winter's free agent market, and his agent, Scott Boras, wants to make that count. Boras has sent teams a 75-page binder on his client, and <strong><a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/21743107/scott-boras-taking-jake-arrieta-pitch-straight-mlb-owners-bypassing-front-offices">according to an MLB executive who spoke with ESPN</a></strong>, the expectation is Arrieta is seeking a $200 million deal.</li>

          <li>J.D. Martinez sat down with the Boston Red Sox at the Winter Meetings and the Sox still look like the favorites to sign Martinez. The market may be thinning on the outfielder as teams are more reluctant to spend big money with the star-studded class that will be on display in 2018. Originally looking for close to $200 million, Martinez may need to settle for just over $100 million over the course of a five-year deal. The team that signs Martinez will be getting a strong hitter with
          good plate discipline, who is also a fairly capable outfielder.</li>

          <li>The Padres continue to be active this offseason and have “traction” in their pursuit of free-agent first baseman Eric Hosmer, 
          according to Yahoo Sports’ Jeff Passan.<br></br>There doesn’t seem to be as much of a market for the 28-year-old Hosmer as was initially 
          projected heading into the offseason, and the Padres have been the club most frequently linked to him. USA TODAY’s Bob Nightengale reported 
          Monday that the Red Sox are now more interested in trading for an impactful hitter than signing Hosmer or J.D. Martinez, and despite the first 
          base opening that could exist in St. Louis, Hosmer hasn’t been connected to the Cardinals very frequently.</li>

          <li>Carlos Santana shocked a vast majority of baseball, turning down offers from favorites to sign him (Indians, Rockies) to sign
          on with the Philadelphia Phillies. The move will surely move rookie phenom Rhys Hoskins to left field for the 2018 season.</li>

          deal. His fly ball rate skyrocketed from 34.7% to 46.2% in 2017, amounting to a whopping 33% increase in fly balls over the last season.</li>

          also tweets </a></strong> that Frazier has expressed a willingness to move around the diamond in an effort to increase his market. Frazier has experience
          at first base in the Majors, and Crasnick notes that he’s willing to play some corner outfield as well. Frazier did log nearly 1000 minor league innings 
          at shortstop, though, and there have been previous reports that some clubs believe Frazier can be an occasional option at second base as well. Though 
          Frazier doesn’t have much big league experience elsewhere on the diamond, he’s been long been a plus defender at third base (+26 DRS and +26.1 UZR 
          over the past five seasons combined).</li>
